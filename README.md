# Simulations for Memory Lab

Welcome! This is a repository that allows for the parameter recovery testing of the ACT-R SOF parameter. Everything in sim is used to simulate, record, and analyze data.

VERY LARGE THANKS TO MAARTEN VAN DER VELDE and his amazing memory lab code. Everything in the slimstampen directory is his great work.

simscripts contains two major components of the test, the ACT-R memory model and the memory lab simulation that tests the memorylab algorithm.
